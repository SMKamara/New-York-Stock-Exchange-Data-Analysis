# New York Stock Exchange Data Analysis 
This project contains a dataset of over 500 companies within the **New York Stock Exchange** ðŸ“ˆðŸ“‰
By _cleaning, manipulating and analyzing_ then filtering the data, I was able to use **__descriptive statistics_** to calculate profit and 
income statements and create forecast future financial metrics using Excel based on historial financial data.
